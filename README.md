# python-api-challenge

## Background: "Data's true power is its ability to definitively answer questions. So, let's take what you've learned about Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What is the weather like as we approach the equator?"

Now, we know what you may be thinking: “That’s obvious. It gets hotter.” But, if pressed for more information, how would you prove that?"

#### In this challenge, API keys were created to find weather data from a randomized location. The first portion of this challenge was to determine a correlation between the latitude and various factors like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and cloudiness on the Southern and Northern Hemipsheres. In the second part of the challenge, weather data was analyzed to determine the best hotel and location to go for vacation.
